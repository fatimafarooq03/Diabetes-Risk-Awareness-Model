# Diabetes Risk Awareness Model
### Overview
This project aims to raise awareness about the risk of developing diabetes among the general public. By utilizing a dataset containing medical and demographic information, we can predict the likelihood of individuals having diabetes or being at high risk. The primary goal is not to achieve clinical-level accuracy, but rather to inform and motivate individuals to adopt healthier lifestyles based on their predicted risk.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It includes the following features:

- Age: The age of the patient.
- Gender: The gender of the patient.
- Body Mass Index (BMI): A measure of body fat based on height and weight.
- Hypertension: Indicates whether the patient has high blood pressure.
- Heart Disease: Indicates whether the patient has heart disease.
- Smoking History: The patient's history of smoking.
- HbA1c Level: A measure of blood sugar levels over the past 2-3 months.
- Blood Glucose Level: The patient's current blood glucose level.

These features are used to predict the target variable, which is the diabetes status of the patient.

### Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to create a model that predicts the likelihood of having diabetes or being at high risk for it. The target audience is the general public, especially those who might not be aware of their risk level. This model is intended to:

- Increase Awareness: Inform individuals of their potential risk of developing diabetes.
- Encourage Lifestyle Changes: Provide insights into how certain lifestyle factors contribute to diabetes risk and encourage positive amendments to reduce or reverse this risk.
- Maximize Public Health Impact: The model prioritizes accuracy in predicting those at risk of diabetes, even if it means some level of inaccuracy, as the main goal is to trigger lifestyle changes rather than diagnose with clinical precision.
### Methodology
The notebook guides users through the following steps:

- Data Exploration: Understanding the dataset, including the distribution of features and the target variable.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data to prepare it for modeling.
- Model Training: Training a machine learning model to predict diabetes status based on the available features.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance, with a focus on identifying individuals at risk of diabetes.
- Insights and Recommendations: Interpreting the model's predictions to offer lifestyle recommendations that could potentially reduce the risk of diabetes.
